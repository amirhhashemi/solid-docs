title: Quick start
---

You can create a new Solid application using the Solid CLI:

```package-create
solid
```

The CLI will prompt you for a few details about your project:

- The name of your project.
- Whether you want to use [SolidStart](/solid-start).
  For full-stack projects, we recommend using SolidStart.
  SolidStart is a meta-framework for Solid that provides features such as file-based routing, nested routing, and multiple rendering modes.
- The starter template you wish to use.
- Whether you want to use TypeScript.

Then, follow the on-screen instructions to install dependencies and run the development server.

## Starter templates

Solid offers a variety of starter templates for popular frameworks and libraries.
You can kickstart your project with one of our templates using the Solid CLI.
Alternatively, you can clone them directly from our [templates repository](https://github.com/solidjs/templates).

:::tip[StackBlitz]
You can try our templates directly in your browser using [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/).
To do this, replace `<template-name>` in the following URL with the name of the template and open it in your browser:

`https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/<template-name>`

For example, the link below opens a fully-featured development environment in your browser for our TypeScript template:
