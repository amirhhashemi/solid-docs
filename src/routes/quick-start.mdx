## Try Solid online

If you want to experiment with Solid in your browser, visit our [interactive playground](https://playground.solidjs.com/).

You can also set up a complete build environment directly in your browser using StackBlitz.
To get started, try the [TypeScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/ts) or [JavaScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/js) templates.
Solid offers many more templates, which you can explore in the [starter templates](#starter-templates) section.

## Create a Solid project

You can create a new Solid application using the Solid CLI:

```package-create
solid
```

The CLI will prompt you for a few details about your project:

- The name of your project.
- Whether you want to use [SolidStart](/solid-start).
  For full-stack projects, we recommend using SolidStart.
  SolidStart is a meta-framework for Solid that provides features such as file-based routing, nested routing, and multiple rendering modes.
- The [starter template](#starter-templates) you wish to use.
- Whether you want to use TypeScript.

If you are uncertain about an option, simply choose the default by pressing enter.

Once the project is created, follow the on-screen instructions to install dependencies and run the development server.

## Starter templates

Solid offers a variety of starter templates for popular frameworks and libraries.
You can see all of them the [templates repository](https://github.com/solidjs/templates).

The best way to kickstart your project with one of the templates is using the Solid CLI.

Additionally, you can try the templates directly in your browser using [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/).
To do this, replace `<template-name>` in the following URL with the name of the template you want to use, and open it in your browser:

```
https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/<template-name>
```

For example, the link below opens a complete development environment in your browser for the TypeScript template:
[https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/ts](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/ts)
