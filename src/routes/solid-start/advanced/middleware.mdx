title: "Middleware"
---

Middleware intercepts HTTP requests and responses, allowing you to modify headers, handle redirects, or send custom responses.
It also provides a `event.locals` object for sharing request-specific data across pages and API routes.

## Use cases

Some common scenarios where middleware shines include:

- **Request and Response Header Management**: Add, modify, or remove headers to control caching, security, or custom behavior.
- **Global Data Sharing**: Store and share request-specific data using the `event.locals` object, accessible throughout your server.
- **Server-Side Redirects**: Redirect users based on request properties, such as locale, authentication state, or custom query parameters.
- **Request Preprocessing**: Perform lightweight preprocessing, such as validating tokens or normalizing paths.

While middleware is powerful, certain tasks are better handled elsewhere:

- **Authorization**: Middleware does not run for every request, making it unsuitable for critical security checks. Perform these checks within API routes or server-side utilities instead.
- **Heavy Computation or Long-Running Processes**: Middleware should remain lightweight. CPU-intensive tasks or prolonged operations are better handled by dedicated route handlers or background jobs.
- **Direct Database Operations**: Avoid querying databases in middleware. Use server-side utilities or route handlers for such operations.
- **Complex Business Logic**: Middleware is not designed for implementing or orchestrating application-specific business logic. Keep this logic in application layers or server functions.

## Create your first middleware

1. Use the `createMiddleware` function to declare your middleware, and `export default` the response:

```ts title="src/middleware/index.ts"
import { createMiddleware } from "@solidjs/start/middleware";

export default createMiddleware({
	onRequest: () => {
		console.log("A request comes in");
	},
});
```

2. Tell SolidStart where your middlewares are defined:

```ts title="app.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
	middleware: "src/middleware/index.ts",
});
```

## Event handlers

Middleware uses two lifecycle events to control execution: `onRequest` and `onBeforeResponse`.

### `onRequest`

The `onRequest` event fires at the beginning of the request lifecycle, before your application code runs. This is your opportunity to:

- Perform early redirects
- Store request-specific data in `event.locals` for later use
- Add or modify request headers

### `onBeforeResponse`

The `onBeforeResponse` event fires after your application code has generated a response but before it's sent to the client. This is where you can:

- Modify response headers
- Log response metrics

## `event.locals` object

`event.locals` is an object that can be manipulated inside a middleware.

This `locals` object is forwarded across the request handling process and is available anywhere in the server (e.g. API routes, server-only queries and actions) through the [`getRequestEvent`](https://docs.solidjs.com/reference/server-utilities/get-request-event) function.
This is useful for storing request-specific data across the server.

You can store any type of data inside `locals`: strings, objects, and even functions and maps.

```ts
import { createMiddleware } from "@solidjs/start/middleware";

export default createMiddleware({
	onRequest: (event) => {
		event.locals.user = {
			name: "John Wick",
		};

		event.locals.sayHello = () => {
			return "Hello, " + event.locals.user.name;
		};
	},
});
```

Then you can use this information anywhere in the server with `getRequestEvent`:

```ts title="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { getRequestEvent } from "solid-js/web";
import { query, createAsync } from "@solidjs/router";

const getUser = query(async () => {
  "use server";
  const event = getRequestEvent();
  return {
    name: event?.locals?.user?.name,
    greeting: event?.locals?.sayHello(),
  };
}, "user");

export default function Page() {
  const user = createAsync(() => getUser());

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {user()?.name}</p>
      <button onClick={() => alert(user()?.greeting)}>Say Hello</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="note">
	The value of `locals` cannot be changed during runtime. Overriding locals
	risks erasing all user-stored information. SolidStart performs checks and will
	throw an error if `locals` are modified.
</Callout>

## Working with headers

The request or response headers are accessible through the `event.(request|response).headers` object, which follows the standard Web API interface. You can use the native `Headers` methods to read or modify headers.

```ts
import { createMiddleware } from "@solidjs/start/middleware";

export default createMiddleware({
	onRequest: (event) => {
		// Read a request header
		const userAgent = event.request.headers.get("user-agent");

		// Set a new request and response header
		event.request.headers.set("x-custom-request-header", "hello");
		event.request.headers.set("x-custom-respnose-header1", "hello");
	},
	onBeforeResponse: (event) => {
		// Set a new response header
		event.response.headers.set("x-custom-respnose-header2", "hello");
	},
});
```

### CORS

You can configure CORS headers in middleware to allow cross-origin request.

```ts
import { createMiddleware } from "@solidjs/start/middleware";
import { json } from "@solidjs/router";

const trustedOrigins = ["https://my-app.com", "https://another-app.com"];

export default createMiddleware({
	onRequest: (event) => {
		event.response.headers.set("Vary", "Origin, Access-Control-Request-Method");

		const origin = event.request.headers.get("origin") ?? "";
		const isAllowedOrigin = trustedOrigins.includes(origin);

		const { pathname } = new URL(event.request.url);
		const isApiRequest = pathname.startsWith("/api");

		// Apply CORS to API routes only
		if (isAllowedOrigin && isApiRequest) {
			// Handle preflight requests
			if (
				event.request.method === "OPTIONS" &&
				!!event.request.headers.get("Access-Control-Request-Method")
			) {
				return json(null, {
					headers: {
						"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": origin,
						"Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, PUT, DELETE",
						"Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type, Authorization",
					},
				});
			}

			// Handle normal requests
			event.response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin);
		}
	},
});
```

## Using cookies

Cookies are stored in the `Cookie` header for requests and in `Set-Cookie` for responses.

Vinxi offers helpers for managing cookies.

```ts
import { createMiddleware } from "@solidjs/start/middleware";
import { getCookie, setCookie } from "vinxi/http";

export default createMiddleware({
	onRequest: (event) => {
		// Get a cookie
		const theme = getCookie(event.nativeEvent, "theme");

		// Set a new cookie
		setCookie("affiliate", "my-affiliate-id");
	},
});
```

You can [read more about Vinxi helpers here](https://vinxi.vercel.app/api/server/cookies.html).

## Chaining middlewares

Both `onRequest` and `onBeforeResponse` event handlers can accept an array of middleware functions. In this case, all middleware will be executed in order.

```ts
import { createMiddleware } from "@solidjs/start/middleware";
import { type FetchEvent } from "@solidjs/start/server";

function middleware1(event: FetchEvent) {
	event.request.headers.set("x-custom-header1", "hello-from-middleware1");
}

function middleware2(event: FetchEvent) {
	event.request.headers.set("x-custom-header2", "hello-from-middleware2");
}

export default createMiddleware({
	onRequest: [middleware1, middleware2],
});
```

## Redirects

Solid-Router provides a `redirect` helper that can be used to redirect the user to a different URL within a middleware.

```ts
import { createMiddleware } from "@solidjs/start/middleware";
import { redirect } from "@solidjs/router";

const REDIRECT_MAP: Record<string, string> = {
	"/signup": "/auth/signup",
	"/login": "/auth/login",
};

export default createMiddleware({
	onRequest: (event) => {
		const { pathname } = new URL(event.request.url);

		if (pathname in REDIRECT_MAP) {
			return redirect(REDIRECT_MAP[pathname], 301);
		}
	},
});
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Protecting routes

Middleware is not guaranteed to run on every single route change. So do not use it for protecting a route agains auauthenticated users.

### Authorization

Although using middleware for authentication and authorization is a common practice in many web frameworks, it is not advisable to use SolidStart middleware for these purposes.

This is because SolidStart middleware is not guaranteed to run on every single request.

For optimal security, all checks should be performed as close to your data source as possible.
