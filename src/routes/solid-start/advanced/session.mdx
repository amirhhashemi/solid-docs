Sessions allow web applications to maintain state between user requests.
Since HTTP is stateless, each request is treated independently.
Sessions address this by allowing the server to recognize multiple requests from the same user, which is helpful for tracking authentication and preferences.


## How sessions work

A session typically involves:

1. **Session creation**: When tracking is needed (e.g., upon login or first visit), the server creates a session.
   This involves:
   - Generating a unique **session ID**.
   - Storing the session data _encrypted and signed_ within a cookie.
2. **Session cookie transmission**: The server sends a `Set-Cookie` HTTP header.
   This instructs the browser to store the session cookie.
3. **Subsequent requests**: The browser automatically includes the session cookie in the `Cookie` HTTP header for requests to the server.
4. **Session retrieval and data access**: For each request, the server:
   - Checks for the session cookie.
   - Retrieves session data from the cookie.
   - Decrypts and verifies the signature of the session data.
   - Application code can access and use this data.
5. **Session expiration and destruction**: Sessions typically expire after a time or upon user logout.
   Destruction involves instructing the browser to delete the session cookie (e.g., setting an expired `Set-Cookie`).

Most of these steps are automatically managed by [session helpers](#session-helpers).

### Database sessions

For larger applications or when more robust session management is required, SolidStart also supports storing session data in a database.
This approach is similar to the cookie-based approach, but with some key differences:

1. A session ID is generated.
2. The session data is stored in the database, associated with the session ID.
3. Only the session ID is stored in the cookie.
4. The session data is retrieved from the database using the session ID.
5. Upon expiration, in addition to the session cookie, the database record containing the session data is also removed.

Note that managing interactions with the database is not directly supported by SolidStart; you will need to implement this yourself.

## Session helpers

[Vinxi](https://vinxi.vercel.app), the underlying server toolkit powering SolidStart, provides helpers to simplify working with sessions.
It provides a few key session helpers:

- [`useSession`](https://vinxi.vercel.app/api/server/session.html#usesession): Initializes a session or retrieves the existing session and returns a session object.
- [`getSession`](https://vinxi.vercel.app/api/server/session.html#getsession): Retrieves the current session or initializes a new session.
- [`updateSession`](https://vinxi.vercel.app/api/server/session.html#updatesession): Updates data within the current session.
- [`clearSession`](https://vinxi.vercel.app/api/server/session.html#clearsession): Clears the current session.

These helpers only work in server-side contexts, such as within server functions and API routes.
This is because session management requires access to server-side resources and the ability to get and set HTTP headers.

For more information, see the [Cookies documentation in Vinxi](https://vinxi.vercel.app/api/server/session.html).

## Creating a session

The `useSession` helper is the primary way to create and manage sessions.
It provides a comprehensive interface for all session operations.

```ts title="src/lib/session.ts"
import { useSession } from "vinxi/http";

type SessionData = {
	theme: "light" | "dark";
};

export async function useThemeSession() {
	"use server";
	const session = await useSession<SessionData>({
		password: process.env.SESSION_SECRET as string,
		name: "theme",
	});

	// Initialize the session if it doesn't have a value
	if (!session.data.theme) {
		await session.update({
			theme: "light",
		});
	}

	// Return the session manager for later use
	return session;
}
```

In this example, the `useThemeSession` server function creates a session that stores a user's theme preference.

`useSession` requires a strong password for encrypting and signing the session cookie.
This password must be at least 32 characters long and should be kept highly secure.
It is strongly recommended to store this password in an environment variable, as shown in the example above, rather than hardcoding it in your source code.

You can generate a suitable password using a command like this:

```sh frame="none"
openssl rand -base64 32
```

`useSession` adds a `Set-Cookie` HTTP header to the current server response.
By default, the cookie is named `h3`, but can be customized with the `name` option, as we did in the example above.

## Getting session data

The `useSession` helper provides access to the session data through the `data` property.

```ts title="src/lib/session.ts"
export async function getThemeSession() {
	"use server";
	const session = await useThemeSession();

	return session.data.theme;
}
```

## Updating session data

The `useSession` helper provides an `update` method to modify session data.

```ts title="src/lib/session.ts"
export async function updateThemeSession(data: SessionData) {
	"use server";
	const session = await useThemeSession();

	await session.update(data);
}
```

## Clearing a session

The `useSession` helper provides a `clear` method to destory the session.

```ts title="src/lib/session.ts"
export async function clearThemeSession() {
	"use server";
	const session = await useThemeSession();

	await session.clear();
}
```
